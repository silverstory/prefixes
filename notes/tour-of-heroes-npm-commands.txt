// This tutorial sample mimics communication with a remote data server by using the In-memory Web API module.
// After installing the module, the app will make requests to and receive responses from the HttpClient without knowing that the In-memory Web API is intercepting those requests, applying them to an in-memory data store, and returning simulated responses.
// This facility is a great convenience for the tutorial. You won't have to set up a server to learn about HttpClient.
// It may also be convenient in the early stages of your own app development when the server's web api is ill-defined or not yet implemented.

// note: run the npm below inside "cmd" as an administrator NOT in 'Cmder'

npm install angular-in-memory-web-api --save
